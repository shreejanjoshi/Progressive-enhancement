            <h2>The story</h2>
        </header>

        <p> Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.
            That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,
            <i><q class="red">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q></i>
            The farmer said,
            <i><q  class="green">Maybe.</q></i>
            The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,
            <i><q class="red">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q></i>
            The farmer again said,
                <i><q class="green">Maybe.</q></i>
            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,
                <i><q class="red">Oh dear, that’s too <em class="red" class="cap">bad</em>,</q></i>
            and the farmer responded,
                <i><q class="green">Maybe.</q></i>
            The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
            Again all the neighbors came around and said,
                <i><q class="red">Isn’t that great!</q></i>
            Again, he said,
                <i><q class="green">Maybe.</q></i>
            The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that
            happens in it is <em class="green" class="cap">good</em> or <em class="red" class="cap">bad</em> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the
            consequences of <em class="green" class="cap">good</em> fortune.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p><em class="green" class="cap">Good</em> and <em class="red" class="cap">bad</em> are just one perspective. Bananas are <em class="green" class="cap">Good</em> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <em class="green" class="cap">Good</em> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p></section>
